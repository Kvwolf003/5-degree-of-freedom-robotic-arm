## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🛠️ Assembly Steps:

```text
1. Print/Fabricate all mechanical parts.
2. Assemble joints and mount servo motors.
3. Wire servos to microcontroller.
4. Upload control firmware.
5. Calibrate initial servo positions.
6. Test manual or programmed control.
```

### 🔌 Example Pin Mapping:

```text
Base Servo      -> Pin 3
Shoulder Servo  -> Pin 5
Elbow Servo     -> Pin 6
Wrist Rotation  -> Pin 9
Wrist Pitch     -> Pin 10
```

## 🎮 Control Modes

* **Manual Mode:** Joystick or Potentiometer-based control.
* **Automated Mode:** Predefined motion sequences.
* **(Optional) Vision Mode:** Integration with cameras and sensors.
